# Project Overview

**PROJECT TITLE:** **_Analysing parcel activation in decision-making tasks versus the resting state_**

**Team:** Energetic Iguanas

**Mentor:** Dr. Balazs Ujfalussy

**Background:** Gambling involves rigorous decision-making and related behaviours (risk-assessment, stress etc). Decision-making is a complex cognitive process that involves the simultaneous orchestration of multiple neural systems. Through this project, we are trying to analyse the activities of decision-making brain regions and decide some conclusions on them.

**Regions of interest:** The orbitofrontal cortex (OFC), the prefrontal cortex (PFC) and the hippocampus.

**Scientific Question:** We wanted to answer the following questions:
1. Are these 3 regions functionally connected to each other?
2. How do their activities differ in a decision-making task (like gambling) from the resting-state?

**Presumption:** The participants in the dataset are healthy, neurotypical individuals with no form of addiction towards gambling.

**Dataset:** HCP-2020 (fMRI)
